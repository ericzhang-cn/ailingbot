# What is AilingBot

AilingBot is an open-source engineering development framework and an all-in-one solution for integrating AI models into
IM chatbots. With AilingBot, you can:

- ‚òï **Code-free usage**: Quickly integrate existing AI large-scale models into mainstream IM chatbots (such as WeChat
  Work, Feishu, DingTalk, Slack etc.) to interact with AI models through IM chatbots and complete business
  requirements. Currently, AilingBot has built-in capabilities for multi-turn dialogue and document knowledge Q&A, and
  more capabilities will be added in the future.
- üõ†Ô∏è**Secondary development**: AilingBot provides a clear engineering architecture, interface definition, and necessary
  basic components. You do not need to develop the engineering framework for large-scale model services from scratch.
  You only need to implement your Chat Policy and complete end-to-end AI model empowerment to IM chatbots through simple
  configurations. It also supports expanding to your own end (such as your own IM, web application, or mobile
  application) by developing your own channel.

# Features

- üíØ **Open source & Free**: Completely open source and free.
- üì¶ **Ready to use**: No need for development, with pre-installed capabilities to integrate with existing mainstream IM
  and AI models.
- üîó **LangChain Friendly**: Easy to integrate with LangChain.
- üß© **Modular**: The project is organized in a modular way, with modules dependent on each other through abstract
  protocols. Modules of the same type can be implemented by implementing the protocol, allowing for plug-and-play.
- üíª **Extensible**: AilingBot can be extended to new usage scenarios and capabilities. For example, integrating with new
  IMs, new AI models, or customizing your own chat policy.
- üî• **High performance**: AilingBot uses a coroutine-based asynchronous mode to improve system concurrency performance.
  At the same time, system concurrency processing capabilities can be further improved through multi-processes.
- üîå **API Integration**: AilingBot provides a set of clear API interfaces for easy integration and collaboration with
  other systems and processes.

# üöÄ Quick Start

## Start an AI chatbot in 5 minutes

Below is a guide on how to quickly start an AI chatbot based on the command-line interface using AilingBot. The effect
is shown in the following figure:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericzhang-cn/ailingbot/main/img/command-line-screenshot.png" alt="Command-line chatbot"/>
</p>

> üí° First, you need to have an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, refer to relevant materials on the Internet to
> obtain it.

### Using Docker

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ericzhang-cn/ailingbot.git ailingbot
cd ailingbot
docker build -t ailingbot .
docker run -it --rm \
  -e  AILINGBOT_POLICY__LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY={your OpenAI API key} \
  ailingbot poetry run ailingbot chat
```

### Using PIP

#### Installation

```shell
pip install ailingbot
```

#### Generate Configuration File

```shell
ailingbot init --silence --overwrite
```

This will create a file called `settings.toml` in the current directory, which is the configuration file for AilingBot.
Next, modify the necessary configurations. To start the bot, only one configuration is needed. Find the following
section in `settings.toml`:

```toml
[policy.llm]
_type = "openai"
model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
openai_api_key = ""
temperature = 0
```

Change the value of `openai_api_key` to your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Start the Chatbot

Start the chatbot with the following command:

```shell
ailingbot chat
```

## Start API Service

### Using Docker

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ericzhang-cn/ailingbot.git ailingbot
cd ailingbot
docker build -t ailingbot .
docker run -it --rm \
  -e  AILINGBOT_POLICY__LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY={your OpenAI API key} \
  ailingbot poetry run ailingbot api
```

### Using PIP

#### Installation

```shell
pip install ailingbot
```

#### Generate Configuration File

Same as starting the command line bot.

#### Start the Service

Start the bot using the following command:

```shell
ailingbot api
```

Now, enter `http://localhost:8080/docs` in your browser to see the API documentation. (If it is not a local start,
please enter `http://{your public IP}:8080/docs`)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericzhang-cn/ailingbot/main/img/swagger.png" alt="Swagger API Documentation"/>
</p>

Here is an example request:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/chat/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "text": "‰Ω†Â•Ω"
}'
```

And the response:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "conversation_id": "default_conversation",
  "uuid": "afb35218-2978-404a-ab39-72a9db6f303b",
  "ack_uuid": "3f09933c-e577-49a5-8f56-fa328daa136f",
  "receiver_id": "anonymous",
  "scope": "user",
  "meta": {},
  "echo": {},
  "text": "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºÅÂæàÈ´òÂÖ¥Âíå‰Ω†ËÅäÂ§©„ÄÇÊúâ‰ªÄ‰πàÊàëÂèØ‰ª•Â∏ÆÂä©‰Ω†ÁöÑÂêóÔºü",
  "reason": null,
  "suggestion": null
}
```

## Integrating with WeChat Work

-p 8080: 8080
ailingbot poetry run ailingbot serve
```

### Using PIP

#### Installation

```shell
pip install ailingbot
```

#### Generate Configuration File

```shell
ailingbot init --silence --overwrite
```

#### Modify Configuration File

Open `settings.toml`, and fill in the following section with your WeChat Work robot's real information:

```toml
[channel]
name = "wechatwork"
corpid = "" # Fill in with real information
corpsecret = "" # Fill in with real information
agentid = 0 # Fill in with real information
token = "" # Fill in with real information
aes_key = "" # Fill in with real information
```

In the `llm` section, fill in your OpenAI API Key:

```toml
[policy.llm]
_type = "openai"
model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
openai_api_key = "" # Fill in with your real OpenAI API Key here

# üìñUser Guide

## Main Process

The main processing flow of AilingBot is as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericzhang-cn/ailingbot/main/img/flow.png" alt="Main Process" width="500"/>
</p>

1. First, the user sends a message to the IM bot.
2. If a webhook is configured, the instant messaging tool will forward the request sent to the bot to the webhook
   service address.
3. The webhook service processes the original IM message and converts it into AilingBot's internal message format, which
   is then sent to ChatBot.
4. ChatBot processes the request and forms a response message based on the configured chat policy. During this process,
   ChatBot may perform operations such as requesting a large language model, accessing a vector database, or calling an
   external API to complete the request processing.
5. ChatBot sends the response message to the IM Agent. The IM Agent is responsible for converting the AilingBot internal
   response message format into a specific IM format and calling the IM open capability API to send the response
   message.
6. The IM bot displays the message to the user, completing the entire processing process.

## Main Concepts

- **IM bot**: A capability built into most instant messaging tools that allows administrators to create a bot and
  process user messages through a program.
- **Channel**: A channel represents different terminals, which can be an IM or a custom terminal (such as the web).
- **Webhook**: An HTTP(S) service used to receive user messages forwarded by IM bots. Different channels have their own
  specifications for webhooks, so each channel requires its own webhook implementation.
- **IM Agent**: Used to call IM open capability APIs. Different IM open capability APIs are different, so each channel
  requires a corresponding agent implementation.
- **ChatBot**: The core component used to receive and respond to user messages.
- **Chat Policy**: Defines how to respond to users and is called by ChatBot. A chat policy specifically defines the
  robot's abilities, such as chitchat or knowledge Q&A.
- **LLM**: Large language model, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and open ChatGLM, are all different large language models. The
  large language model is a key component for implementing AI capabilities.

## Configuration

### Configuration Methods

AilingBot can be configured in two ways:

- **Using configuration files**: AilingBot reads `settings.toml` in the current directory as the configuration file
  in [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format. Please refer to the following section for specific configuration items.
- **Using environment variables**: AilingBot also reads configuration items in environment variables. Please refer to
  the following section for a list of environment variables.

> üí° Both configuration files and environment variables can be used together. If a configuration item exists in both, the
> environment variable takes precedence.

### Configuration Mapping

All configurations have the following mappings between TOML keys and environment variables:

- All environment variables start with `AILINGBOT_`.
- Double underscores `__` are used as separators between levels.
- Underscores in configuration keys are preserved in environment variables.
- Case-insensitive.

For example:

- The corresponding environment variable of `some_conf` is `AILINGBOT_SOME_CONF`.
- The corresponding environment variable of `some_conf.conf_1` is `AILINGBOT_SOME_CONF__CONF_1`.
- The corresponding environment variable of `some_conf.conf_1.subconf` is `AILINGBOT_SOME_CONF__CONF_1__SUBCONF`.

### Configuration Items

lang = "zh_CN"
tz = "Asia/Shanghai"

[policy]
name = "conversation"
# More policy configurations

[channel]
name = "wechatwork"
# More channel configurations

[uvicorn]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
```

#### Built-in Policy Configuration

##### conversation

Conversation uses LangChain's Conversation as the policy, which enables direct interaction with LLM and has a
conversation history context, enabling multi-turn conversations.

| Configuration Item | Description                                                   | TOML                | Environment Variable           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| History Size       | Indicates how many rounds of historical conversations to keep | policy.history_size | AILINGBOT_POLICY__HISTORY_SIZE |

Configuration example:

```toml
# Use the conversation policy and keep 5 rounds of historical conversations
[policy]
name = "conversation"
history_size = 5
```

##### document_qa

Document_qa uses LangChain's [Stuff](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff) as the policy.
Users can upload a document and then ask questions based on the document content.

| Configuration Item | Description                                       | TOML                 | Environment Variable            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Chunk Size         | Corresponds to LangChain Splitter's chunk_size    | policy.chunk_size    | AILINGBOT_POLICY__CHUNK_SIZE    |
| Chunk Overlap      | Corresponds to LangChain Splitter's chunk_overlap | policy.chunk_overlap | AILINGBOT_POLICY__CHUNK_OVERLAP |

Configuration example:

```toml
# Use the document_qa policy, with chunk_size and chunk_overlap set to 1000 and 0, respectively
[policy]
name = "document_qa"
chunk_size = 1000
chunk_overlap = 0
```

#### Model Configuration

The model configuration is consistent with LangChain. The following is an example.

##### OpenAI

```toml
[policy.llm]
_type = "openai" # Corresponding environment variable: AILINGBOT_POLICY__LLM___TYPE
model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo" # Corresponding environment variable: AILINGBOT_POLICY__LLM__MODEL_NAME
openai_api_key = "sk-pd8I'm sorry, it seems like your message got cut off. Can you please provide me with more information or clarify your request?
```

# ü§îFrequently Asked Questions

- Due to the fact that WeChat Work does not support uploading file event callbacks, the built-in `document_qa`
  policy cannot be used for WeChat Work.
- The webhook of each IM requires a public IP. If you do not have one, you can consider testing locally through the "
  intranet penetration" solution. Please refer to online resources for specific methods.
- We expect the chat policy to be stateless, and the state should be stored externally. However, in specific
  implementations, the policy may still have local states (such as storing conversation history in local variables).
  Therefore, when uvicorn has multiple worker processes, these local states cannot be shared because each process has a
  separate chat policy instance, and a request from the same user may be responded to by different workers, leading to
  unexpected behavior. To avoid this, please ensure that at least one of the following two conditions is met:
    - Chat policy does not use local states.
    - Only one uvicorn worker is started.
