# Quick Start Guide

## Start an AI chatbot in 5 minutes

Below you will see how to quickly start a command-line-based AI chatbot through AilingBot, with the effect as shown in
the figure:

> ðŸ’¡First, you need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, apply here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

### Through Docker

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ericzhang-cn/ailingbot.git ailingbot
cd ailingbot
docker build -t ailingbot .
docker run -it --rm -e AILINGBOT_POLICY__LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY={Your OpenAI API key} ailingbot poetry run ailingbot bot chat
```

### Through PIP

#### Install

```shell
pip install ailingbot
```

#### Generate configuration file

```shell
ailingbot init --silence --overwrite
```

At this point, a file called settings.toml will be created in the current directory, which is AilingBot's configuration
file.
Next, modify the necessary configurations. To start the robot, only one configuration is required. Find the following
section in settings.toml:

```toml
[policy.llm]
_type = "openai"
model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
openai_api_key = ""
temperature = 0
```

Change the value of `openai_api_key` to your real OpenAI API key.

#### Start the robot

Start the robot with the following command:

```shell
ailingbot bot chat
```

## Integrating Instant Messaging Tools

Here's how to quickly integrate the above robot into WeChat Work.

### Through Docker

```shell
export AILINGBOT_CHANNEL__AGENTID={Your Enterprise WeChat application AgentId}
export AILINGBOT_CHANNEL__CORPSECRET={Your Enterprise WeChat application CorpSecret}
export AILINGBOT_CHANNEL__AES_KEY={Your Enterprise WeChat application Webhook AES Key}
export AILINGBOT_CHANNEL__CORPID={Your Enterprise WeChat application CorpId}
export AILINGBOT_CHANNEL__TOKEN={Your Enterprise WeChat application Webhook Token}
export AILINGBOT_POLICY__LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY={Your OpenAI API key}
docker compose up
```

### Through PIP

#### Modify the configuration file

Open `settings.toml` and fill in the following section with your Enterprise WeChat application's real information:

```toml
[channel]
name = "wechatwork"
corpid = ""
corpsecret = ""
agentid = 0
token = ""
aes_key = ""
```

#### Start the service

```shell
ailingbot bot serve
ailingbot bot channel serve_agent
ailingbot bot channel serve_webhook
```

Finally, we need to go to the Enterprise WeChat management console to configure the webhook address so that Enterprise
WeChat knows to forward the received user messages to our webhook.
The URL of the webhook is: `http(s)://your_public_IP:8080/webhook/wechatwork/event/`

After completing the above configuration, you can find the robot in Enterprise WeChat and start a conversation:
